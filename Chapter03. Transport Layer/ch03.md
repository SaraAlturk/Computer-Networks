## 3.1 Introduction and Transport-Layer Services

A transport-layer protocol provides for logical communication (as if the hosts running the processes were directly connected) between application processes running on different hosts.

- Application processes use the logical communication provided by the transport layer to send messages to each other, free from the worry of the details of the physical infrastructure used. 

- Transport-layer protocols are implemented in the **end systems but not in network routers**
  
-  On the sending side, the transport layer converts the application messages into transport-layer packets,(transport-layer segments)   by breaking them into smaller chunks and adding a transport-layer header to each chunk. The transport-layer then passes the segment to the network-layer packet at the sending end-system.
  
-  On the receiving side, the network layer extracts the transport-layer segment from the datagram and passes the segment up to the transport-layer which then processes the received segment, 
making the data in the segment available to the received application.

### 3.1.1 Relationship Between Transport and Network Layers
A transport-layer protocol provides for logical communication between application processes running on different hosts. relies on, enhances, network layer services

A network-layer protocol provides logical communication between hosts.

![Network](

### 3.1.2 Overview of the Transport Layer in the Internet
- The Protocol Data Unit (PDU) at the transport layer is called a segment (for TCP) or a datagram (for UDP).
- A TCP/IP network (such as the Internet) makes two distinct transport-layer protocols available to the application layer:

**Comparison of TCP and UDP**

| **Aspect**                 | **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**                           | **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**                                  |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Service Model**          | Reliable and connection-oriented                                | Unreliable and connectionless                                   |
| **Application Selection**  | Chosen by the application developer                            | Chosen by the application developer                            |
| **Terminology**            | Uses "segment" for segments                                    | Uses "datagram" for segments                                   |
| **Network Layer Protocol** | Operates on top of IP (Internet Protocol)                      | Operates on top of IP (Internet Protocol)                      |
| **Services Provided**      | Reliable data transfer, flow control, sequence numbers, acknowledgments, timers, and congestion control | Process-to-process data delivery and error checking            |
| **Reliability**            | Reliable - Ensures data delivery, integrity, and order          | Unreliable - Does not guarantee data integrity or delivery      |
| **Congestion Control**     | Regulated - Prevents excessive traffic and aims for fair sharing of network resources | Unregulated - No congestion control                            |
| **Complexity**             | Complex due to additional services and mechanisms              | Simpler and less complex                                       |
| **Key Features**           | In-order delivery, flow control, congestion control, connection setup | Unordered delivery, no flow or congestion control, no connection setup |
| **Services Not Available** | No delay or bandwidth guarantees                              | No delay or bandwidth guarantees                              |


## 3.2 Multiplexing and Demultiplexing
<p align="center">

</p>
- The transport layer in intermediate hosts performs both demultiplexing and multiplexing.They occur based on segment, datagram header field values. Happens at all layers

**Multiplexing**
- Performed by the sender's transport layer, which combines data from multiple application processes (sockets), attaches the necessary headers (containing source and destination port numbers), and passes the segments to the network layer for transmission.
- Multiplexing involves gathering data from different sockets, encapsulating it with header information to create segments, and passing the segments to the network layer.
- Sockets have unique identifiers. Special fields in segments identify the socket for delivery.
- These fields include `source port number` and `destination port number`.
- Port numbers are 16 bit numbers, ranging from 0 to 65535. The well known port numbers (0 to 1023) are reserved for established application protocols.

**Demultiplexing**
- The job of delivering the data in a transport-layer segment to the correct socket 
- Performed by the receiver's transport layer, which reads the headers of incoming segments, identifies the destination port numbers, and delivers the data to the correct socket .
- Transport layer delivers data to an intermediary socket, not directly to a process.

- Hosts uses IP addresses & port numbers to direct segment to the corresponding socket, ensuring data is delivered to the correct process.
  - UDP:  datagram has source IP address, destination IP address. delievers using destination port number (only) for demultiplexing 
  - TCP:  segment using 4-tuple: source and destination IP addresses, and port numbers

**Connectionless Multiplexing and Demultiplexing** 
1. Socket and Port Assignment :A socket is created and bound to local-host with specific port number.
 `DatagramSocket mySocket1 = new DatagramSocket(12534);`

2. Sending UDP Datagram: When creating the datagram source host must specifies `Destination IP address and Destination port number`
3. Receiving UDP Datagram: The transport layer at the receiving host inspects the `destination port number` in the UDP header then directs it to approperiate socket. **It Only uses destination port for demultiplexing**
   
   - Even if the datagrams come from different source IPs or source ports, as long as they share the same destination port, they will all be directed to the same socket on the receiving host.
   - The source port number in a UDP segment serves as part of the **"return address"**. It allows the recipient to send a response back to the sender.

**Connection-oriented Multiplexing and Demultiplexing**
- A TCP socket is identified by the four-tuple: (`source IP address`, `source port number`, `destination IP address`, `destination port number`)
-  When a TCP segment arrives from the network to a host, the host **uses all four values to demultiplex the segment to the appropriate socket**
-  A single server can handle multiple TCP connections simultaneously; each socket identified by 4-tuple and is  associated with a different connecting client
-   Two arriving TCP segments with different source IP addresses or source port numbers will (with the exception of a TCP carrying the original connection establishment request) be directed to two different sockets.
