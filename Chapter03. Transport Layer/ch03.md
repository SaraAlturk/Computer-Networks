## 3.1 Introduction and Transport-Layer Services

A transport-layer protocol provides for logical communication (as if the hosts running the processes were directly connected) between application processes running on different hosts. 

Application processes use the logical communication provided by the transport layer to send messages to each other, free from the worry of the details of the physical infrastructure used. 
Transport-layer protocols are implemented in the end systems but not in network routers
. On the sending side, the transport layer converts the application messages into transport-layer packets, known as transport-layer segments.
This is done by breaking them into smaller chunks and adding a transport-layer header to each chunk. The transport-layer then passes the segment to the network-layer packet at the sending end-system.
On the receiving side, the network layer extracts the transport-layer segment from the datagram and passes the segment up to the transport-layer which then processes the received segment, 
making the data in the segment available to the received application.

### 3.1.1 Relationship Between Transport and Network Layers
A transport-layer protocol provides logical communication between processes running on different hosts. Whereas a network-layer protocol provides logical communication between hosts.


### 3.1.2 Overview of the Transport Layer in the Internet
A TCP/IP network (such as the Internet) makes two distinct transport-layer protocols available to the application layer:

UDP [ User Datagram Protocol], which provides an unreliable, connectionless service to the invoking application
TCP [Transmission Control Protocol] which provides a reliable, connection-oriented service to the invoking application.
We need to spend a few words on the network-layer protocol: the Internet network-layer protocol is the IP (Internet Protocol). It provides a logical communication between hosts. The IP service model is a best-effort delivery service: it makes the best effort to deliver segments between hosts, but it doesnt provide guarantees:

it doesn't guarantee segment delivery
it doesn't guarantee orderly delivery of segments
it doesn't guarantee the integrity of the data in the segments
Thus IP is said to be an unreliable service. Every host has at least one network-layer address a so-called IP address.
