## 8.1 What Is Network Security?
The following desirable properties of secure communication.
-  Confindentiality: only sender and receiver should be able to understand the contents of the transmitted message -> encryption by sender and decryption by reciever
- Message integrity: make sure the content of the communication is not altered in transit or after it is recieved -> checksum
- End-point authentication: sender and receiver should be able to confirm the identity of the other party involved in the communication.
- Operation security: ability to counter attacks to internal networks -> firewalls, IPS, IDS
= access and availability: services must be accessible and available to users

-Trudy, an intruder, tries to disrupt the communication by: Intercepting, deleting, or adding messages between Alice and Bob.

**What Can a "Bad Guy" (Attacker) Do?**
- Eavesdrop: Intercept communication without altering it.
- Insert Messages: Actively add malicious messages into a connection.
- Modify or Delete Messages: Alter or remove messages in transit.
- Impersonation: Spoof the source address of a message or any part of the packet to deceive the receiver.
- Hijacking: Take over an ongoing communication session by removing one of the parties (either the sender or the receiver) and inserting the attacker in their place.
- Denial of Service (DoS): Overload the system or resources to prevent service from being available to others.
  
## 8.2 Principles of Cryptography
- Suppose that Alice wants to send a message to Bob. The original form is known as plaintext, or cleartext.
- Alice encrypts her plaintext message using an encryption algorithm so that the encrypted message, known as ciphertext, looks unintelligible to any intruder(Trudy).

- **m**: Plaintext message  
- **K<sub>A</sub>(m)**: Ciphertext, encrypted with key **K<sub>A</sub>**  
- **m = K<sub>B</sub>(K<sub>A</sub>(m))**

**Breaking an Encryption Scheme**
- **Ciphertext-only attack:** Trudy (the attacker) only has the ciphertext and tries to decrypt it. There are two approaches to breaking the encryption:
  - Brute force: The attacker tries all possible keys.
  - Statistical analysis: The attacker uses statistical properties of language (common letters like "e" and "t" in English) to guess the key.
- **Known-plaintext attack**: Trudy knows both the plaintext and the corresponding ciphertext. For example, in a monoalphabetic cipher, if Trudy knows "a" corresponds to "m," "l" to "n," and so on, she can deduce the key.
- **Chosen-plaintext attack**: Trudy can choose a plaintext message and obtain the corresponding ciphertext, which can help her analyze the encryption algorithm further.

### Symmetric Key Cryptography
- In symmetric key cryptography, both Alice and Bob use the same key (KS) for encryption and decryption.
- Encryption Process: Alice encrypts her plaintext using the shared key KS.
- Decryption Process: Bob uses the same key KS to decrypt the ciphertext back to the original plaintext.
Example: A substitution cipher could be an example of symmetric key cryptography, where the key is the pattern used for substituting letters.

Key Sharing Challenge: The main question is: How do Alice and Bob agree on the key value (KS) securely? This is a major challenge in symmetric key cryptography since the key must be shared safely to avoid interception by attackers like Trudy.

**Simple Encryption Scheme**
**Monoalphabetic Cipher**
- Each letter in the plaintext is mapped to a single, unique letter in the ciphertext.
- **Example**:
  - **Plaintext**: bob. i love you. alice  
  - **Ciphertext**: nkn. s gktc wky. mgsgc  
- **Encryption Key**: A mapping of 26 letters to 26 other letters, providing \( 26! \) possible pairings.

**Sophisticated Encryption Approach**
**Multialphabet Cipher (Polyalphabetic Cipher)**
- Uses multiple monoalphabetic ciphers in a cyclic pattern.
- **Example**:
  - Word **"dog"** encrypted with a cycle of 4 substitution ciphers: \( M_1, M_3, M_4, M_2 \).
  - The same letter in plaintext may be encrypted differently based on its position.
- **Encryption Key**:
- A combination of:
  - Multiple substitution ciphers.
  - A cyclic pattern.
 - Not constrained to a fixed bit-length.


**Symmetric Key Cryptography: DES and AES**

**DES: Data Encryption Standard**
- **Definition**: US encryption standard [NIST 1993].
- **Key Features**:
  - 56-bit symmetric key, 64-bit plaintext input.
  - Block cipher with Cipher Block Chaining (CBC).
- **Security**:
  - **DES Challenge**: A 56-bit-key-encrypted phrase was decrypted (brute force) in less than a day.
  - No known good analytic attack.
- **Enhancements**:
  - **3DES**: Encrypt three times with three different keys for added security.

**AES: Advanced Encryption Standard**
- **Definition**: Symmetric-key NIST standard, replaced DES (Nov 2001).
- **Key Features**:
  - Processes data in 128-bit blocks.
  - Supports 128, 192, or 256-bit keys.
- **Security**:
  - Brute force decryption (testing every key):
    - Takes 1 second for DES.
    - Takes 149 trillion years for AES.


### Public Key Encryption 
- Radically Different Approach: Public key cryptography represents a different paradigm from symmetric key cryptography (e.g., Diffie-Hellman and RSA algorithms).
- No Shared Secret Key: The sender and receiver do not need to share a secret key in advance.
- Public Key: The encryption key is made public, meaning it is known to everyone.
- Private Key: The decryption key is kept private and is known only to the receiver.
- This method allows for secure communication even if the sender and receiver have never met and do not share any initial secrets.

**Requirements**:
1. **Key Pair Relationship**:
   - Need $$K_B^+(\cdot)$$ and  $$K_B^-(\cdot)$$ such that:
     $$K_B^-\left(K_B^+(m)\right) = m$$
2. **Security**:
   - Given the public key $$K_B^+$$, it should be computationally infeasible to derive the private key  K_B^-$$ 

**Example Algorithm**:
- **RSA**: Rivest, Shamir, Adleman algorithm.
