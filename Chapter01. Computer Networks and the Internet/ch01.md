**1.1 What is the Internet?**

**1.1.1 A nuts-and-bolts description**

- The Internet is a computer networks that interconnects hundreds of millions of computing devices through the world.
    
    These devices  are called hosts or end-systems like: Desktop computers, laptops, Linux workstations, Smartphones, Tablets, Gaming consoles, Home security systems and Watches.
    
    All the devices connected to the Internet are called **hosts** or **end systems**. 
    
- End systems are connected together by a network of **communication links** and **packets switches**.
    
    Different links can transmit data at different rates, with the **transmission rate** of a link measured in bits/second.
    
- When one end system has data to send to another end system, the sending end system *segments* the data and adds *header bytes* to each segment.
    
    The resulting packages of information, called **packets**, are then sent through the network to the destination and system where they a reassembled into the original data.
    
- A packet switch takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication links and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing communication links.
    
    The two most prominent types of packets switches are **routers** and **link switches**. 
    
    The sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a packet from the sending end system to the receiving end system is known as **route** or **path**.
