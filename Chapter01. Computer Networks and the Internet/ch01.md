## 1.1 What is the Internet?
**1.1.1 A nuts-and-bolts description**

- The Internet is a computer networks that interconnects hundreds of millions of computing devices through the world.
    
    These devices  are called hosts or end-systems like: Desktop computers, laptops, Linux workstations, Smartphones, Tablets, Gaming consoles, Home security systems and Watches.
    
    All the devices connected to the Internet are called **hosts** or **end systems**. 
    
- End systems are connected together by a network of **communication links** and **packets switches**.
    
    Different links can transmit data at different rates, with the **transmission rate** of a link measured in bits/second.
    
- When one end system has data to send to another end system, the sending end system *segments* the data and adds *header bytes* to each segment.
    
    The resulting packages of information, called **packets**, are then sent through the network to the destination and system where they a reassembled into the original data.
    
- A packet switch takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication links and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing communication links.
    
    The two most prominent types of packets switches are **routers** and **link switches**. 
    
    The sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a packet from the sending end system to the receiving end system is known as **route** or **path**.
    
- End systems access the Internet through **Internet Service Providers (ISPs)**, including residential ISPs (cable or phone company), corporate, university ISPs ...
    
    Each ISP in itself is a network of packet switches and communication links.
    
    ISPs provide a variety of types of network access to the end systems, including residential broadband access such as cable modem or DSL, high-speed local area network access, wireless access, and 56 kbps dial-up modem access.
    
    *A Lower tier* (which interconnect end-systems) ISPs are interconnected through national and international *upper tier* ISP. 
    
    An *upper-tier* ISP consists of high speed routers interconnected with high-speed fiber-optic links. Each ISP network is managed independently.
    
- End systems, packet switches, and other pieces of the Internet run protocols that control the sending and receiving of information within the Internet.
    - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
    - Internet Protocol (IP)
- **Internet standards** are developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)  and documented as Requests for Comments (**RFCs)**
    
    Define protocols such as TCP, IP, HTTP (for the Web), and SMTP (for e-mail)
    
**1.1.2 A Services Description**

- The Internet can be described as *an infrastructure that provides services to applications*.
- Internet applications include electronic mail, Web surfing, social networks, instant messaging, Voice- over-IP (VoIP), video streaming, distributed games, peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing, television over the Internet, remote login, and much, much more.
    
    These applications were said to be **distributed** since they involve multiple end systems that exchange data with each other.
    
- **Internet applications run on end systems, not in the packet switches or routers**, packet switches facilitate the exchange of data, but they are not concerned with the application that is the source or sink of data.
- End systems provide **Application Programming Interface (API)** that specifies how a program running on one end system asks the Internet infrastructure to deliver data to a specific destination program running on another end system.

**1.1.3 What Is a Protocol?**

All the activity in the Internet that involves two or more communicating remote entities is governed by a protocol.

**A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the trasmission and/or receipt of a message or other event**

## 1.2 The Network Edge
- Computers and other devices connected to the Internet are often referred to as *end systems* as they sit at the edge of the Internet.
    
    They are also called *hosts* as they host, run, applications programs such as a Web Browser or an email client.
    
    - Hosts can be divided into clients (desktops, laptops, smartphones) and servers (more powerful machines).
        
        Servers store and distribute content, often in large data centers.
      
        Large companies like Google have multiple data centers worldwide with millions of servers.
      
**1.2.1 Access Networks**

- They are the networks that physically connect end systems to the first router on a path from the end system to any other distant end system.
    - residential access networks
    - institutional access networks (school, company)
    - mobile access networks (WiFi, 4G/5G)
      
- **Home Access: DSL, Cable, FITH, Dial-Up and Satellite**
- Today, the two most prevalent types of broadband residential access are **digital subscriber line (DSL)** and **cable**.

**Access networks: digital subscriber line (DSL)**
<p align="center">
  <img width="530" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-19 at 2 35 36 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d5f6d2b-39e6-4376-8bc1-96fa0fc37403">
</p>
- A residence typically gets Internet access using the **existing telephone line**

- Data travels over the DSL line to the **central office** where the signal is split: data is routed to the Internet, while voice traffic is routed to the telephone network.
  
-  A device called a **DSL Access Multiplexer (DSLAM)** at the central office separates voice and data traffic and directs it accordingly.
-   **Transmission Speeds**
    - **Downstream** (data from the Internet to the user): 24-52 Mbps.
    - **Upstream** (data from the user to the Internet): 3.5-16 Mbps.
    
    Both upstream and downstream transmission rates are **dedicated**, meaning they are not shared with other users on the same line
    
    The access is asymmetric because the downstream and upstream rates are different.
    
**Access Network: Fiber to the Home (FTTH):**
<p align="center">
  <img width="530" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-19 at 2 37 54 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f453ca5-9695-4299-8af1-f966cc015ce5">
</p>
-  FTTH provides a dedicated optical fiber path from the **central office (CO) to individual homes.

- FTTH is fast, can deliver speeds of up to **10 Gbps** with typical downstream speeds around **200 Mbps**.
  
- Optical distribution networks for FTTH include direct fiber and shared fibers.
    - **Direct Fiber**: A single fiber optic cable runs directly from the central office to a specific home, ensuring a dedicated connection.
    - **Split Fiber**: More common than direct fiber, split fiber involves multiple homes sharing a single fiber line leaving the central office. The fiber is split using **optical splitters** to serve many homes from one central fiber.

**Wireless Access Networks**

1. **Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs)**:
    - Typically operates within a building or close proximity (~100 ft = few tens of meters)
    - Uses **IEEE 802.11b/g/n (WiFi)** standards for communication
    - Transmission rates: 11 Mbps, 54 Mbps, up to 450 Mbps for more modern implementations.
    - **Example**: Home WiFi networks connecting devices like phones, laptops, etc.
2. **Wide-Area Cellular Access Networks**:
    - Provided by mobile operators such as 4G/5G networks.
    - Transmission rates: 10s of Mbps.
    - Covers larger areas (tens of kilometers) using cellular towers to connect devices to the Internet.

**Access networks: enterprise networks**

- Used by large institutions such as companies, universities, etc.
- End systems (like computers) typically connect through Ethernet switches.
- Mix of wired, wireless link technologies, connecting a mix of switches and routers
    - Ethernet supports wired access at speeds ranging from 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps and up to 10 Gbps.
    - WiFi access points provide wireless connectivity, supporting various speeds like 11, 54, and 450 Mbps.

**Access networks: Data Center Networks**

- High-bandwidth links (ranging from 10 Gbps to 100 Gbps) connect **hundreds to thousands of servers** inside data centers.
- These servers are interconnected and linked to the Internet to provide vast computing power and data storage.
- **Data Center Networks** are crucial for cloud services, hosting websites, and handling large-scale applications.

**1.2.2 Physical Media**

- Physical media is categorized as
    - Guides media: the waves are guided along a solid medium (fiber-optic cable, twisted-pair copper wire, coaxial cable)
        - Twisted-pair copper wire
            - Consists of two insulated copper wires, each about 1 mm thick, arranged in a regular spiral pattern
            - The wires are twisted together to reduce the electrical interference from similar pairs close by.
            - Categories:
                - **Category 5**: Supports 100 Mbps and 1 Gbps Ethernet.
                - **Category 6**: Supports 10 Gbps Ethernet.
            - **Drawback**: Susceptible to electromagnetic noise, which can affect performance.
        - Coaxial cable
            - Consists of two copper conductors, but the two are concentric rather than parallel.
            - **Bidirectional**: Can carry signals in both directions.
            - **Broadband**: Multiple frequency channels, capable of transmitting different signals simultaneously.
            - Transmission speeds can reach **hundreds of Mbps per channel**.
            - **Hybrid Fiber Coax (HFC)**: Used in modern broadband systems.
        - Fiber-optic cable
            - An optical fiber is a thin, flexible medium (glass fibers) that conducts pulses of light, with each pulse representing a bit.
            - **High-speed** operation: Can achieve 10 -100s of Gbps.
            - **Low error rate**: Immune to electromagnetic interference, with repeaters spaced far apart to maintain signal quality.
    - Unguided media: the waves propagate in the atmosphere and in outer space (wireless LAN, digital satellite channel)
        - **Wireless Radio**
            - Signals are broadcast through electromagnetic spectrum bands, without the need for wires.
            - **Half-duplex** communication (send or receive but not both simultaneously).
            - Affected by environmental factors like:
                - **Reflection**,
                - **Obstruction by objects**, and
                - **Interference/noise**.
            
            **Radio link types:**
            
            1. Wireless LAN (WiFi):  10-100’s Mbps; 10’s of meters
            2. wide-area (e.g., 4G/5G cellular): 10’s Mbps (4G) over ~10 Km
            3. Bluetooth: cable replacement, short distances (5 to 10 m) limited rates (1 or 2 Mbps)
            4. Terrestrial microwave:  point-to-point; 45 Mbps channels
            5. Satellite: Speeds up to 100 Mbps for downlinks. High latency: 270 msec end-to-end delay due to the distance between earth and geostationary satellites.
               

## 1.3 The Network Core
- Two fundamental approaches for moving data through a network of links and routers: Packet Switching and Circuit Switching
<p align="center">
  <img width="530" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-17 at 10 39 36 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b81c3d3-3c19-4db9-baac-a282741c9083">
</p>
Forwarding is the local action of moving arriving packets from router’s input link to appropriate router output link, while routing is the global action of determining the source-destination paths taken by packets.

**1.3.1 Packet Switching**
- In a network application, end systems  (Hosts) exchange messages by breaking the source message  into smaller packets.
  
  These packets travel through communication links and packet switches (primarily routers and link-layer switches) between source and destination.Each packet is transmitted over a communication link at the link's full transmission rate.
  
  The time to transmit a packet of L bits over a link with transmission rate R bits/sec is L/R seconds.
    
$$
\text{packet transmission delay} = \text{time needed to transmit an L-bit packet into the link} = \frac{L \, \text{(bits)}}{R \, \text{(bits/sec)}}
$$

**Store-and-forward Transmission**
- Most packet switches use store-and-forward transmission at the inputs to the links. 
<p align="center">
  <img width="530" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-17 at 11 01 05 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37bdc2b9-6068-4a99-850c-1aca2f563a14">
</p>
- Store-and-forward transmission means that the packet switch must receive the entire packet before it can begin to transmit the first bit of the packet onto the outbound link. The link must buffer (store) the packet's bits and only after the router has received all of the packet's bits can it begin to transmit (forward) the packet onto the outbound link.

**Queuing Delays and Packet Loss**
- Each packet switch (router) has multiple links attached to it. For each attached link, the packet switch has an **output buffer** (**output queue**) which stores packets that the router is about to send into that link.
<p align="center">
  <img width="530" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-18 at 12 46 54 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61240be0-5382-4d0a-97b4-dd3e1e88c212">
</p>
-  When a packet arrives at a switch and needs to be sent over a link that's already in use/busy (transmitting another packet), it cannot be sent immediately. The packet is placed in the output buffer to wait its turn for transmission.
  
-  The time a packet spends waiting in the output buffer before it can be transmitted is Queuing Delays, This delay isn't constant; it varies based on network congestion levels.
  
-  Output buffer space is finite have a limited size; they can only hold a certain number of packets. Buffer Overflow: Occurs when incoming packets exceed the buffer's capacity. In this case, packet loss will occur, either the arriving packet or one of the already queued packets will be dropped.
  
- If arrival rate (in bps) to link exceeds transmission rate (bps) of link for some period of time:
1. packets will queue, waiting to be transmitted on output link
2. packets can be dropped (lost) if memory (buffer) in router fills up

**Forwarding tables and routing protocols**
- When a source end system wants to send a packet to a destination end system, the source includes the destination's IP address in the packet's header.
- Each router has a **forwarding table** that maps destination addresses (or portions of the destination addresses) to that router's outbound links.
- When a packet arrives at the router, the router examines the address and searches its forwarding table, using this destination address, to find the appropriate outbound link. A number of special **routing protocols** are used to automatically set the forwarding tables.

**1.3.2 Circuit Switching**
- In circuit-switched networks, the resources needed along a path(buffers, link transmission rate) to provide for communication between the end systems are **reserved** for the duration of the communication sessions.
- When two hosts want to communicate, the network establishes a **dedicated end-to-end connection** between them.

**Multiplexing in Circuit-Switched Networks**
- A circuit in a link is implemented with either **frequency-division multiplexing (FDM)** or **time-division multiplexing (TDM)**.

| **Aspect** | **FDM (Frequency Division Multiplexing)** | **TDM (Time Division Multiplexing)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Resource Division** | Optical, electromagnetic frequencies(spectrum) divided into narrow frequency bands  | Time is divided into frames of fixed duration, and each frame is divided into a fixed number of time slots. |
| **Transmission** | Each user transmits simultaneously but on a different frequency band. | Each user transmits during their assigned time slot, one at a time. |
| **Bandwidth Usage** | Each call is allocated its own narrow band and can transmit at the maximum rate of that band. | Each call is allocated periodic time slots and can transmit at a maximum rate of the wider frequency band during its slot. |
| **Representation in Diagram** | <img width="335" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-18 at 7 26 43 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d66f9268-b48e-451a-acfb-3985030793f8"> | <img width="335" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-18 at 7 28 19 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78fa32aa-d702-4232-89cf-a237bdf6a85b"> |
| **User Allocation** | Each user is allocated a fixed frequency band for continuous transmission. | Each user is allocated periodic time slots for data transmission. |
| **Example** | Radio and TV broadcasting, where each station has its own frequency. | Telecommunication systems where each user transmits data in a specific time slot. |
- **FDM**: Each user has **a fixed portion of the bandwidth** and uses it continuously, but that portion is smaller, so their transmission speed is limited by the size of their frequency band.
- **TDM**: Each user has **access to the entire bandwidth( can transmit at full capacity)**, but only for brief time slots before the next user, allowing them to transmit at a higher rate during those slots.


**Packet Switching Vs Circuit Switching**

Packet switching is more flexible, uses resources efficiently and is simpler to implement (even if it requires congestion control). Circuit switching offers performance guarantees but uses resources inefficiently

<p align="center">
  <img width="530" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-18 at 8 50 16 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c998001-2a8d-4c2b-bfce-bac36327b777">
</p>

| **Aspect**               | **Circuit Switching**                                    | **Packet Switching**                                    |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Resource Allocation**   | Pre-allocates fixed resources (bandwidth) for each user. | Dynamically allocates resources based on demand.         |
| **Efficiency**            | Less efficient; unused bandwidth remains idle.           | More efficient; resources are shared only when needed.   |
| **Delay**                 | Low, predictable delay due to dedicated resources.       | Variable delay due to queuing, but optimized for usage.  |
| **Real-Time Suitability** | Better for real-time services like voice calls.          | Less suitable for real-time services without optimization.|
| **Number of Users**       | Limited by the number of fixed slots or circuits.        | Can handle many more users with shared bandwidth.        |
| **Example 1**             | 10 users share a 1 Mbps link with 100 kbps each.         | 35 users can share a 1 Mbps link with low collision risk.|
| **Example 2**             | One active user limited by fixed slot time.              | One active user can use the full bandwidth of the link.  |
| **Trend**                 | Traditional, but shifting towards packet switching.      | Widely used, even for some telephone networks.           |



**1.3.3 A Network of Networks**

- To create the Internet, various **Internet Service Providers (ISPs)**  must be interconnected creating a *network of networks*.
- **Hosts** (end systems like computers, mobile devices) connect to the Internet through **access ISPs** (local ISPs). Access ISPs must be interconnected with one another to enable data to travel across the globe, allowing **any two hosts to communicate**. The Internet is highly **complex** due to this interconnection, influenced by factors such as **economics** and **national policies**.
- Directly connecting each access ISP to another access ISP would be inefficient and impractical, leads to an exponential increase in the number of required connections (O(N²)). not easy to scale.
  
  <img width="358" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-18 at 8 41 02 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/561d1b9e-5249-4d68-b503-b6bc57112301">
    
- *Network Structure 1* interconnects all access ISPs with a single global transit ISP. *Network Structure 2* introduces multiple global transit ISPs, allowing access ISPs to choose among competing providers. ***N**etwork Structure 3* adds regional ISPs between access ISPs and global transit ISPs, creating a multi-tiered hierarchy. *Network Structure 4* introduces Points of Presence (PoPs) at all levels except the access ISP level. PoPs are locations where ISPs connect to provider ISPs. It also introduces Internet Exchange Points (IXPs)*,* where multiple ISPs can interconnect and exchange traffic directly, improving efficiency.

  <img width="358" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-18 at 8 42 06 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd855261-1340-424e-81bf-9bb290c28e10">

- Today's Internet is complex, consisting of a dozen or so tier-1 ISPs and hundreds of thousands of lower-tier ISPs. The ISPs are diverse in their coverage, with some spanning multiple continents and oceans, and others limited to narrow geographic regions.

## 1.4 Delay, Loss, and Throughput in Packet-Switched Networks
- Computer networks necessarily constrain throughput (the amount of data per second that can be transferred) between end system, introduce delays between end systems and can actually lose packets.
  
**1.4.1 Overview of Delay in Packet-Switched networks**
- As a packet travels from one node (host or router) to the subsequent host along his path, it suffers from several types of delays at *each* node along the path.

| **Source of Delay**         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Delay Duration**                  | **Formula/Key Parameters**                                                                                                                                                      |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Nodal Processing Delay**   | Time required to examine the packet's header and determine where to direct the packet. Includes time to check bit-level errors and determine the correct output link.                                            | Typically less than microseconds    | No specific formula                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Queueing Delay**           | Time waiting at the router's output link for transmission, depends on congestion level. If the queue is empty, queueing delay will be 0.                                                                         | Microseconds to milliseconds        | No specific formula                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Transmission Delay**       | Time required to push (transmit) all of the packet's bits into the link.                                                                                                                                         | Microseconds to milliseconds        | $$\( d_{trans} = \frac{L}{R} \)$$ where \( L \) is the packet length (bits) and $$\( R \)$$ is the link transmission rate (bps).                                                        |
| **Propagation Delay**        | Time required for the bit to propagate from the start of the link to the next router. Depends on the physical medium and distance between the sender and receiver.                                               | Milliseconds                        | $$\( d_{prop} = \frac{d}{s} \)$$ where $$\( d \)$$ is the length of the physical link, and \( s \) is the propagation speed $$(~\( 2 \times 10^8 m/s \)$$).                                 |

**1.4.2 Queuing Delay and Packet Loss**

Packet Queueing Delay: depends on the balance between the arrival rate of packets and the capacity of the link

Key Variables:
- $$\( \alpha \)$$: Average packet arrival rate (packets per second)
- $$\( L \)$$: Packet length (in bits)
- $$\( R \)$$: Link bandwidth or transmission rate (bits per second)

Traffic Intensity: $$\( \frac{L \cdot \alpha}{R} \)$$
- $$\( \frac{L \cdot \alpha}{R} \approx 0 \)$$: When traffic intensity is close to 0, the average queueing delay is small. This happens when the arrival rate of bits is much smaller than the service rate.
- $$\( \frac{L \cdot \alpha}{R} \to 1 \)$$: As traffic intensity approaches 1, the average queueing delay becomes large. This is when the arrival rate and service rate are almost equal
-  $$\( \frac{L \cdot \alpha}{R} > 1 \)$$: If traffic intensity exceeds 1, the queueing delay becomes infinite as more data arrives than can be processed.

- Low Traffic Intensity: Small queueing delay, similar to a smooth highway with few cars.
- High Traffic Intensity: High queueing delay, similar to a traffic jam when too many cars are on the road.

- As **traffic intensity** increases, the delay grows exponentially, leading to congestion.
  
- A queue preceding a link has finite capacity. If a packet finds a full queue, then the router will **drop** it, the packet will be lost. The fraction of lost packets increases as the traffic intensity increases.
- 
- lost packet may be retransmitted by previous node, by source end system, or not at all

**1.4.3 End-to-End Delay**

The **end-to-end delay** refers to the total time taken for a packet to travel from the source host to the destination host across a series of routers. This is different from **nodal delay**, which is the delay experienced at a single router.

**Network Setup**:

- There are **N - 1 routers** between the source and destination hosts.
- The network is **uncongested**, meaning that **queueing delays are negligible**.
- The **processing delay** at each router and at the source host is dproc.
- The **transmission rate** out of each router and the source host is R bits/sec.
- The **propagation delay** on each link is dprop.

the nodal delays accumulate and give: $$d_{(end-to-end)} = N * [d_{proc} + d_{trans} + d_{prop}]$$

Traceroute program: provides delay measurement from source to router along end-end Internet path towards destination. For all i:
• sends three packets that will reach router i on path towards
destination (with time-to-live field value of i)
• router i will return packets to sender
• sender measures time interval between transmission and reply

**1.4.4 Throughput in Computer Networks**

- Throughput refers to the rate at which data/bits is successfully transferred from sender to receiver
    - **Instantaneous Throughput**: Defined as the rate (in bits per second) at which a receiver, like Host B, receives data at any given moment.
    - **Average throughput :** rate at longer period of time is calculated by dividing the total file size F (in bits) by the timeT  taken to transfer the file:  ${ avg-throughput} = \frac{F}{T}$
- In a simple network with a server and client connected by two links (server-to-router link Rs and router-to-client link Rc) throughput is determined by the **bottleneck :**  slowest link in the path
    - If Rs≤Rc, the throughput is Rs.
    - If Rc≤Rs, the throughput is Rc.
- The overall throughput is determined by the **minimum** of the two transmission rates: $Throughput=min⁡(Rc,Rs)$
- **File Transfer Time**: The approximate time to transfer a file of size FFF (bits) from server to client is:${Transfer Time} = \frac{F}{\min(R_s, R_c)}$
  
    The bottleneck link determines how fast the file can be transferred.
  
- **per-connection end-to-end throughput** is:  $\min(R_c, R_s, \frac{R}{N})$
    - example:  Suppose Rs = 2 Mbps, Rc = 1 Mbps, R = 5 Mbps, What is the end end-to-end throughput for each of the 10 downloads? 500 kbps

## 1.5 Protocol Layers and Their Service Models
**1.5.1 Layered Architecture**

**Protocol Layering**

- To provide structure to the design of network protocols, the network designers organize protocols in **layers**. **Each protocol belongs to one of the layers**.
- We are interested in the **services** that a layer offers to the layer above, **service model** of a layer. When taken together, the protocols of the various layers are called the **protocol stack**. The Internet protocol stack consists of five layers: Application, Transport, Network, Link, Physical
- Protocol layering has conceptual and structural advantages:
    - Layering provides a structured way to discuss system components. Helps identify the individual components of a system (such as hosts, routers, protocols, etc.) and their relationships.
    - Modularity (dividing the system into distinct layers) makes it easier to update system components. Changes in one layer do not affect the rest of the system.

## Layered Internet Protocol Stack and Encapsulation:

| **Layer**        | **Function**                                                                                                                   | **Encapsulation**                                                                                         |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Application**  | Network applications and application-layer protocols (HTTP, SMTP, FTP, DNS). Applications exchange **messages** over the network. | Adds application data $(message \(M\))$ for communication between applications on different end systems. $[M]$  |
| **Transport**    | Transports application-layer messages between application endpoints. Uses **TCP** for reliable connection-oriented transmission and **UDP** for connectionless transmission. | Adds **transport header** $\( H_T \)$ to create a **transport segment**. TCP provides flow control, reliability, and congestion control. UDP is lightweight with no guarantees. $[H_T][M]$ |
| **Network**      | Moves network-layer packets known as **datagrams** from one host to another using the IP Protocol. Also includes **routing protocols** for path determination. | Adds **network header** $\( H_N \)$ to create a **network datagram**. Handles addressing and routing of packets. $[H_N][H_T][M]$ |
| **Link**         | Transfers data between neighboring network elements using link-layer protocols like **Ethernet** or **WiFi**. Data units at this layer are known as **frames**. | Adds **link header** $\( H_L \)$ to create a **link-layer frame**. Provides local link addressing and error detection. $[H_L][H_N][H_T][M]$ |
| **Physical**     | Moves individual bits within a frame from one node to the next over the transmission medium. The physical layer is hardware and link-dependent. | Transfers the **bitstream** over the physical medium (copper, fiber, wireless), implementing the frame's transmission. |


**1.5.2 Encapsulation**

<p align="center">
  <img width="530" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-19 at 12 50 42 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03fe5262-4ffc-4d47-bf7e-078a3c820d6f">
</p>


Routers and link-layer switches are both packet switches but routers and link-layer switches do not implement all of the layers in the protocol stack: link-layer switches implement Physical and Link while router add the Network Layer too.

From the Application Layer, the message passes to the transport layer, which appends additional information to it (the **Header**) that will be used by the receiver-side transport layer. The transport layer then adds its own header and passes the datagram to the link layer which adds it own link-layer header information. Thus, we see that at each layer, a packet has two types of fields: **header fields** and a **payload field**, the payload typically being the packet from the layer above.

## 1.6 Networks Under Attack

- The **original vision** of the Internet was for a small group of mutually trusting users connected to a transparent network. Security was not a priority in its early design.
- Today, the **Internet protocol designers are playing catch-up**, adding security measures to protect against various cyber threats.
- Security now needs to be considered at **all layers** of the network protocol stack.
- **Key Considerations for Network Security**:
    - **How attackers can compromise networks**: Understanding the methods attackers use to breach systems is essential.
    - **How to defend against attacks**: Implementing measures to safeguard networks and protect data is critical.
    - **How to design secure architectures**: Building networks with security as a priority (known as **security by design**) is crucial for resilience against attacks.

**Malware**

- Malware: Malicious software that can infect devices via the Internet.
- Once a device infected, the malware can do all kinds of evil things:
    - **Delete files**:  remove critical or personal data.
    - **Install Spyware**: This type of malware collects sensitive information (keystrokes, passwords, websites visited) and uploads it to a collection site for attackers.
    - **Botnets**: A compromised host may become part of a botnet, a network of infected devices controlled by cybercriminals, often used for **distributed denial of service (DDoS)** attacks, sending spam, or other malicious activities.
    - **Self-replicating malware**: Malware such as viruses and worms can replicate and spread across devices and networks rapidly, infecting multiple systems. Once it infects one host, it seeks entry into other hosts via the Internet.
        - **Viruses** are malware that requires some form of user interaction to infect the user's device.
        - **Worms** are malware that can enter a device without any explicit user interaction.
        

**Denial-of-Service (DoS)**

- Attackers aim to make resources (servers, bandwidth) unavailable to legitimate users by overwhelming the target with bogus traffic.
- Most of them fall into one of the three categories:
    - *Vulnerability Attack*: a few well-crafted messages are sent to a vulnerable application or operating system running on the targeted host. The service might stop or the host might crash.
    - *Bandwidth flooding*: a deluge of packets is sent to the targeted host, so many packets that the target's access link becomes clogged preventing legitimate packets from reaching the server
    - *Connection flooding*: a large number of half-open or fully open TCP connections are established at the targeted host, which can become so bogged down that it stops accepting legitimate connections.
- Process:
    1. The attacker selects a **target** (website or server).
    2. Compromise hosts around the network (see botnet)
    3. Send massive packets  from the compromised hosts to the target, **overloading** it and making it unavailable to real users.
- In a **distributed DoS** (**DDoS**) attack the attacker controls multiple sources and has each source blast traffic at the target.

**Packet Interception (Packet Sniffing)**:

- A passive receiver ( **packet sniffer**) reads and records all packets passing through a network.
- This typically happens in **broadcast media**, such as shared Ethernet or wireless networks.
- The network interface is set to read all packets, even those not intended for the sniffer. This can include sensitive information such as passwords, social security numbers, and private messages.
- Packet sniffers are *passive* (they do not inject packets into the channel), they are difficult to detect. Some of the best defenses against packet sniffing involve cryptography.

**Fake Identity (IP Spoofing)**:

- The ability to inject packets into the Internet with a false source address is known as **IP Spoofing** and is but one of many ways in which one user can masquerade as another user.
- **How it works**: The attacker sends packets with the source address of another machine (epretending to be User A) to deceive the receiver (User B). The receiver believes the packet is from the legitimate source (User A), but it was actually sent by the attacker (User C).
- To solve this problem we will need ***end-point authentication*.T**his mechanism helps verify the origin of a packet to ensure that it is truly from the claimed sender. Authentication can help in determining if the message originates from where it should.

**Lines of Defense**:

- **Authentication**: Verifying that a user or system is who they claim to be.
    - The **simplest form** is the use of **passwords**.
    - In **cellular networks**, SIM cards provide hardware-based identity verification. However, such hardware-based identity mechanisms are not common in traditional Internet connections.
- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that information is only accessible to authorized parties.
    - This is typically achieved via **encryption**, which protects data from being read by unauthorized users during transmission.
- **Integrity Checks**: Ensuring that the data has not been altered or tampered with.
    - **Digital signatures** provide a way to verify the identity of the sender and ensure that the data has not been modified in transit.
- **Access Restrictions**: Implementing methods like **password-protected VPNs** to restrict access to the network. VPNs provide a secure connection and prevent unauthorized users from accessing private networks.
- **Firewalls**: These are specialized network devices ( **middleboxes**) that filter and control incoming and outgoing network traffic.
    - Firewalls are off-by-default can block unauthorized access, filter packets, restrict certain senders or receivers, and help detect and react to **DoS attacks**.
    - They are often found in **access networks** and **core networks** to secure large-scale infrastructures.
