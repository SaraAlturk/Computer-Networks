### Simplified version of chapter 5 

- forwarding: move packets from router’s input to appropriate router output
- routing: determine route taken by packets from source to destination
- **Two control-plane approaches:**
   - Traditional routing algorithms: implemented in routers and use distributed algorithms
       - Per-router control plane: Individual routing algorithm components in each and every router interact in the control plane

    - software-defined networking (SDN): implemented in (remote) servers
       - Software-Defined Networking (SDN) control plane: Remote controller computes, installs forwarding tables in routers

**Routing Protocols**
- Goal: The main goal of routing protocols is to determine good paths (routes) for data packets to travel from the source host to the destination host through a series of routers.
- Routes should be the least cost, fastest, or least congested.
- Path: sequence of routers packets traverse from given initial source host to final destination host

**Routing Algorithm Classification**
Static vs. Dynamic Routes:

- Static Routes: Routes change slowly over time. These types of routes don’t change frequently unless there is a significant event or failure.
- Dynamic Routes: Routes change more frequently. Periodic updates or changes in response to network events, such as link failures or cost updates, can alter the route.

Global vs. Decentralized Information:

- Global Routing: All routers have complete information about the network’s topology (structure of the network) and link costs. This is used by link state algorithms, where every router has detailed knowledge of the entire network.
- Decentralized Routing: Each router has information about its immediate neighbors and iteratively exchanges information to compute routes. This is used in distance vector algorithms, where routers start with knowledge of the costs to directly connected routers and update this based on messages from neighbors.

**Routing Algorithms on the Internet**

**1. Intra-Autonomous System (AS) Routing Protocol**
- **Definition**:
  - Routers within an ISP network and the links between them form an Autonomous System (AS). Routing protocols used within the network are referred to as intra-domain routing protocols.

 **Routing Information Protocol (RIP)**
- **Type**: Distance-vector (Bellman-Ford-like).
- **Function**: Makes decentralized routing decisions based on local information exchanged between neighboring routers.
- **How it Works**:
  - Each router shares its distance information with other routers.
  - Routers update their routing tables based on the received distance information.

**Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)**
- **Type**: Link-state (Dijkstra-like).
- **Function**: Requires global knowledge of the network topology. Each router uses the complete network structure to make routing decisions.
- **How it Works**:
  - Routers exchange information about the state of their links.
  - Each router independently computes the shortest path to every other router using Dijkstra's algorithm.

**2. Routing Among ISPs**
- **Definition**:
  - This type of routing occurs between different Autonomous Systems (AS) and is known as inter-domain routing. It involves the routing of data between different networks (e.g., from one ISP to another).

 **Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)**
- **Type**: Distance-vector (Bellman-Ford).
- **Function**: Responsible for inter-domain routing on the Internet. It enables routing between different networks (ASes) that comprise the global Internet.
- **How it Works**:
  - BGP exchanges routing information between ISPs.
  - Serves as the "glue" that connects all the networks of the Internet, enabling data to route seamlessly across AS boundaries.
