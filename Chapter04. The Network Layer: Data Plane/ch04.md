## 4.1 Overview of Network Layer
- The network layer's primary role is to move packets from a sending host to a receiving host.
  
  <img width="400" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-09 at 9 01 08 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8caa8bd-1fa1-4508-839b-ef96086478fd">
  
- Network layer protocols are implemented in all Internet-connected devices, including hosts and routers.
- Role of routers:
  -  examines header fields in all IP datagrams passing through it to determine where the packet is coming from and where it needs to go.
  -  moves datagrams from input ports to output ports to transfer datagrams along end-end path Based on the destination address in the header 
    
### 4.1.1 Forwarding and Routing: The Data and Control Planes
-  Two key functions are involved:
- **Forwarding/ Data Plane:**
   - Forwarding refers to the **router-local** action of transferring a packet from an input link interface to the appropriate output link interface.
   - Moves packets from a router's input link to the appropriate output link.
   - The primary function in the data plane.
   - Implemented in **hardware**.
   - Takes place every **few nanoseconds**
- **Routing / Control Plane:**
   - Routing refers to the **network-wide** process that determines the end-to-end paths that packets take from source to destination.
   - Determines the route or path datagrams take from sender to receiver.
   - Implemented in the control plane.
   - Routing algorithms calculate these paths.
   - Implemented in **software**
   - Takes place **every few seconds**
- **Two control-plane approaches:**
   - Traditional routing algorithms: implemented in routers and use distributed algorithms
       - Per-router control plane: Individual routing algorithm components in each and every router interact in the control plane
        - <img width="500" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-09 at 9 26 28 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76ab00ff-84a0-4f35-be39-69c3906a33e8">
    - software-defined networking (SDN): implemented in (remote) servers
       - Software-Defined Networking (SDN) control plane: Remote controller computes, installs forwarding tables in routers
       - <img width="500" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-09 at 9 21 14 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adce052c-daad-411a-952c-0e8977836759">

- Every router has a **forwarding table**. When a router receives a packet, it extracts a value from a specific field in the header and searches for that value in in the forwarding table.
- The procedure used to set up and update the table depends on the protocol used. However a router receives and sends *routing protocol messages* to configure its forwarding table.

### 4.1.2 Network Service Model
- The network service model defines the characteristics of end-to-end delivery of packets between sending and receiving hosts.
- These services could include:Guaranteed delivery, Guaranteed delivery with bounded delay,  In-order packet delivery, Guaranteed minimal bandwidth, Security
- **Examples of Service Models**
  - For **Individual Datagrams**:
    - Guaranteed Delivery: Ensures the packet will reach the destination.
    - Guaranteed Delivery with Timing Constraints: Ensures delivery with a maximum delay (e.g., less than 40 ms).
  - For a **Flow of Datagrams**:
    - In-Order Delivery: Ensures packets in a flow arrive in sequence.
    - Guaranteed Minimum Bandwidth: Reserves bandwidth for the flow.
    -  restrictions on changes in inter- packet spacing
- The internet's network layer provides a single service, known as best-effort service. No guarantees on:
   - successful datagram delivery to destination
   - timing or order of delivery
   - bandwidth available to end-end flow
     
<img width="400" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-09 at 9 34 26 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a9cc2b8-994a-433b-897c-8be4475c825c">

**Reflections on Best-Effort Service:**
- Simplicity of Mechanism: The best-effort model is simple, which made the Internet scalable and globally adopted.
- Sufficient Bandwidth Provisioning: allows performance of real-time applications (interactive voice, video) to be “good enough” for “most of the time”
- Distributed Application-Layer Services: (datacenters, content distribution networks) connecting close to clients’ networks, allow services to be provided from multiple locations
- Congestion Control for Elastic Services: Elastic services (web browsing, file downloads) adapt to available bandwidth using congestion control, ensuring stable network behavior.

## 4.2 What’s Inside a Router?
**A high-level view of a generic router architecture**

<img width="500" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-09 at 9 52 38 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f741b46-68d2-46fd-87b4-1af22bd4e628">

### 4.2.1 Input Port Processing and Destination-Based Forwarding
<img width="400" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-10 at 1 17 37 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/637e6e84-e0f4-4e3b-b74e-57bff6e3d55f">

- Input ports: perform the following functions:
   - **Physical layer** function of terminating an incoming physical link at a router.(managing bit-level reception of data.)
   - Link-Layer functions needed to interoperate with the link-layer at the other side of the incoming link (Processes Ethernet frames or other Layer 2 protocols.)
   - Lookup function consulting the forward table to determine the router output port to which an arriving packet will be forwarded via the switching fabric.
- all functionalities need to be processes at ‘line speed’ meaning as soon as they arrive they need to be prpccesed and handed to switch fabric. if switching fabric can't handle all input ports at line speed once there will be input port queuing (datagrams arrive faster than forwarding rate)
- Traditional Forwarding: IP uses destination-based forwarding: forward based only on destination IP address *
- Generalized Forwarding: forward based on any set of header field values
 
**Destination-Based Forwarding**
- Longest prefix matching: when looking for forwarding table entry for given destination address, use longest address prefix that matches destination address.

| **Destination Address Range**         | **Link Interface** |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------|
| 11001000 00010111 00010*** ********** | 0                  |
| 11001000 00010111 00011000 ********** | 1                  |
| 11001000 00010111 00011*** ********** | 2                  |
| Otherwise                             | 3                  |

- 11001000 00010111 00010110 10100001 matches interface 0
- 11001000 00010111 00011000 10101010 matches interface 1 
- Why Longest Prefix Matching? It reduces the size of routing tables by aggregating address ranges.
- How is LPM Implemented? Using Ternary Content Addressable Memories (TCAMs), A specialized memory type used in routers for fast lookups.
   - It's Content Addressable: Unlike standard memory, which retrieves data by address, TCAMs retrieve data based on the content of the query (e.g., IP prefixes).
   - Can retrieve the matching address in one clock cycle, regardless of the size of the routing table.
   - Examples like the Cisco Catalyst router can store up to 1 million routing table entries in TCAM.

## 4.3 The Internet Protocol (IP): IPv4, Addressing, IPv6, and More

### 4.3.1 IPv4 Datagram Format
<p align="center">
  <img width="450" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-10 at 1 47 56 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1e149ed-b502-475a-92f1-05aa28701023">
</p>

| Field                   | Description                                                                                                         |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Version number**      | Specifies the IP protocol version of the datagram (IPv4 or IPv6).                                                      |
| **Header length**       | Determines the start of the payload in the IP datagram; typically 20 bytes for most datagrams.                        |
| **Type of service**     | Bits used to distinguish different types of IP datagrams based on the required level of service.                      |
| **Datagram length**     | Total length of the IP datagram (header plus data) in bytes; maximum theoretical size is 65,535 bytes.                 |
| **Identifier, flags, fragmentation offset** | Fields related to IP fragmentation, where large datagrams are broken into smaller fragments for transmission.        |
| **Time-to-live**        | Ensures datagrams do not circulate indefinitely; decremented by routers, and dropped if it reaches 0.                  |
| **Protocol**            | Indicates the specific transport-layer protocol for the data portion of the IP datagram (e.g., TCP, UDP).             |
| **Header checksum**     | Aids in detecting bit errors in the received IP datagram; computed using 1s complement arithmetic.                    |
| **Source and destination IP addresses** | Source inserts its IP address, and destination's address is determined, usually via DNS lookup.                    |
| **Options**             | Allow IP header extension for rare use cases, but omitted in IPv6 for simplicity.                                      |
| **Data (payload)**      | Contains the transport-layer segment (e.g., TCP or UDP) or other data, such as ICMP messages.                         |

- *Note: An IP datagram typically has a 20-byte header (excluding options). If carrying a TCP segment, each datagram includes a total of 40 bytes of header (20 bytes of IP header plus 20 bytes of TCP header) along with the application-layer message.*
- Overhead: 20 bytes of TCP + 20 bytes of IP = 40 bytes + app layer overhead for TCP+IP

- **Interface**: boundary or connection point where a device (host/router) interacts with the physical link (Ethernet cable/ Wi-Fi). It acts as a gateway for the device to send/receive data over the network.
   - A router has multiple links connected to it, therefore multiple interfaces. For each interface, the router has a unique IP address that identifies it on that specific network.
   - A router has multiple IP addresses and **an IP address is technically associated with an interface rather than with a host or router**
   - A host usually has one or two interfaces (e.g., wired and wireless), so it often has one or two IP addresses.
- How are interfaces actually connected?
   - Wired Interfaces: Devices (e.g., computers) with Ethernet interfaces are connected via **Ethernet switches.**
   - Wireless Interfaces: Devices with Wi-Fi interfaces are connected via a **Wi-Fi base station** (e.g., a wireless router).
- IPv4 addresses are **32 bits long (4 bytes)** -> max 2^32 possible addresses.
    - They are typically writen in **dotted decimal notation** where each byte of the address is written in deciaml from and separated by a period from the others.
    - ex: 223.1.1.1 in binary: 11011111 00000001 00000001 00000001
- Each interface on every host (except host behind NATs) must have a unique IP address. How are these computed? A  portion is determined by the subnet to which the host is connected.
- **Subnet**: device interfaces that can physically reach each other without passing through an intervening router
    -  if two hosts are in the same subnet they can talk to each other without a router
- **IP Address Structure**
   - **Subnet Part:** The high-order bits (first part of the IP) are the same for all devices in the same subnet.
      - 223.1.1.0/24 for the subnet with devices 223.1.1.x.
   - **Host Part:** The low-order bits (remaining part of the IP) are unique for each device in the subnet.
      - IP Address: 223.1.1.3 -> Subnet Part: 223.1.1. -> Host Part: 3 (last 8 bits in binary: 00000011).
   - **Subnet Mask:** Can be any length 1-31
       - /24 Specifies that the first 24 bits of the IP address are for the subnet part.
      - 223.1.1.0/24 means all devices in this subnet share the first 24 bits (223.1.1), with the remaining bits used to identify individual devices.
- To define subnets: Detach each interface from its host or router, creating isolated network islands. Each isolated network forms a subnet.

**Old Classful Addressing**
- IP addressing was originally divided into fixed classes (Class A, B, C) with predefined sizes for the network and host parts.
- Wastage of Address Space
  
**CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)**
- CIDR is the Internet's address assignment strategy, allowing the division of IP addresses into two parts, a network portion and a device portion. This approach improves address allocation efficiency.
- CIDR replaces fixed classes with a flexible subnet size, allowing arbitrary division of the address into subnet and host parts.
- Format: `a.b.c.d/x` where x: Number of bits in the subnet part.
- An organization is assigned a block of contiguous addresses with a common prefix (subnet part)
-  Routers outside the organization network use the subnet prefix (x) to forward packets
- 32-x bits are considered when forwarding packets within the organization
- Example Address: 11001000 00010111 00010000 00000000 (binary for 200.23.16.0/23): [ subnet - host ]
  - Subnet Part: 11001000 00010111 0001000 (23 bits).
  - Host Part: 00000000 (remaining 9 bits).

**How Does a Device Get an IP Address?**
1- Hard coded Manually (Static Configuration) by system administrator.
2- Dynamically using DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) which allows hosts to obtain an IP address from server automatically when they join a network.(plug-and-play)

**DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol**
- goal: allow host to dynamically obtains IP address from network server when it “joins” network
   - The IP address is temporarily leased to the host. If the host stays connected, it can renew the lease before it expires.
   - If the host leaves the network or does not renew its lease, the IP address is returned to the DHCP pool.
   - This address can then be reassigned to another device, ensuring the network doesn't run out of IP addresses.
- DHCP overview:
   - host broadcasts `DHCP discover` msg [optional] across the local network because the client does not yet have an IP address.
   - DHCP server responds with `DHCP offer` msg [optional] The offer includes details such as:The proposed IP address. Subnet mask and gateway.
   - host requests IP address: `DHCP request` msg.  This step confirms the client’s acceptance of the offered IP address.
   - DHCP server sends address: `DHCP ack` msg. The IP address is now leased to the client for a specific duration.
- client does not have an IP address when requesting

**DHCP Client-Server Scenario**

<img width="400" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-10 at 3 01 12 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77982093-e682-4cfa-9552-debeb2b116f4">

- Routers usually act as DHCP servers, managing IP assignment for all subnets they are connected to.
- A DHCP client (a laptop) sends a request for an IP address when it connects to a network.
- The DHCP server (often co-located in a router) provides an IP address from the pool of available addresses.
- Example: A new device joins the network at 223.1.2.0/24 and receives an address like 223.1.2.5 from the DHCP server.

<img width="648" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-10 at 3 02 12 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc942c15-ae32-48ae-bd81-4db5325ec28d">

- DHCP not only assigns an IP address but can also provide additional configuration details to the client:
   - **First-Hop Router Address**: The gateway for the client to communicate with other networks.
   - **DNS Server Address**: The name and IP address of the local DNS server for domain name resolution.
   - **Network Mask**: Indicates which part of the IP address represents the subnet and which part represents the host.

<p align="center">
  <img width="325" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-10 at 3 09 23 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a054dbfc-942c-487d-9462-9500d1537ff5">
</p>

1. Client Connection: A laptop (or other device) connects to the network and uses DHCP to request: Its IP address., The first-hop router's address. and The DNS server's address.
2. Message Encapsulation: The DHCP Request message is encapsulated as UDP → IP → Ethernet frame. The Ethernet frame is broadcasted to the network (destination: FFFFFFFFFFFF).
3. Message Reception: The broadcast is received by the router running the DHCP server. The Ethernet frame is: De-multiplexed to IP -> UDP → DHCP.
4. Server Formulates DHCP ACK: DHCP ACK message containing: The client’s assigned IP address, The IP address of the first-hop router. The name and IP address of the DNS server.
5. ACK Encapsulation: The DHCP ACK message is encapsulated (UDP → IP → Ethernet) and forwarded to the client.
6. Client Configuration: After receiving the ACK, the client knows: Its own IP address. The DNS server’s name and IP.The first-hop router’s IP address.

**How does network get subnet part of IP address?**
- A network gets a subnet part of the IP address by being allocated a portion of its provider ISP's address space.
- ISP owns the address block: `200.23.16.0/20 Binary representation: 11001000 00010111 00010000 00000000.`
- ISP divides its block into 8 smaller blocks for different organizations:
```
Organization 0: 200.23.16.0/23
Organization 1: 200.23.18.0/23
Organization 2: 200.23.20.0/23
…
Organization 7: 200.23.30.0/23.
```
<img width="400" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-10 at 3 38 47 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6f7b0a7-1149-49f0-8c89-725c6f594fd2">

- Hierarchical addressing aggregates routing information, reducing the complexity of routing tables.
- Organizations are allocated subnets like 200.23.16.0/23, 200.23.18.0/23, etc., under the ISP Fly-By-Night-ISP.
   - Organization 1 moves from Fly-By-Night-ISP to ISPs-R-Us.
   - ISPs-R-Us now advertises a more specific route for Organization 1

**Calculate Number of Addresses in a Block**
- Formula : $$2^{32-x} $$
   - x: Number of bits in the network portion of the address.
   - 32−x: Number of bits in the host portion, which determines the total number of addresses.
     
**Example**: A block of addresses is granted to a small organization. We know that one of the addresses is `205.16.37.39/28`. Find the number of addresses in the block?
- The value of x is 28, which means that number of addresses is $$2^{32−28} = 2^4$$ or 16.
  
**Network Configuration for Block `205.16.37.32/28`**
  - Total 16 addresses as calculated . First Address: `205.16.37.32` (network address). Last Address: `205.16.37.47.`
  - <img width="200" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-10 at 11 13 16 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2e22aa4-10e5-4d4a-8089-08fb66e9e5e7">
  - The first address in a block is normally not assigned to any device; it is used as the network address that represents the organization to the rest of the world
  - The first address in a block can be found by setting the rightmost 32 − x bits to 0s.
  -  The last address in a block is used as a **broadcast address** for the organization
  -  The last address in the block can be found by setting the rightmost 32 − x bits to 1s.
  -  Valid Number of Host IP Addresses: $$2^{32−x} −2$$ [Subtract 2 to account for: Network Address (first address) and Broadcast Address (last address)]

Given Address: `205.16.37.39/28`
-  What is the first address in the block?
    - last octet / block size = 39/16 = 2.4375
    - nearest multiple of 16 less than or equal to 39 = 2 x 16 = 32
    - Replace the last octet with 32: `205.16.37.32`
-  What is the last address in the block?
    - Add the block size minus 1 to the first address.
    - 205.16.37.32 + 16 - 1 = 205.16.37.47
- Calculate Valid Hosts: 
    - 16−2=14
- The usable range is from:
   - First Usable Address: First address + 1 → 205.16.37.33.
   - Last Usable Address: Last address - 1 → 205.16.37.46.
     
**Dividing a block of subnets**
Given Block: 17.12.14.0/26 (64 addresses in total).
The organization needs to divide this block into three subnets with:
32 addresses (Subnet 1).
16 addresses (Subnet 2).
16 addresses (Subnet 3).

- Assign Masks for Each Subnet
    - **Subnet 1 (32 addresses)**:  $$2^{32-n_1} = 32$$  where $$n_1$$ is the number of network bits.
      - Solve for $$n_1$$: $$32 - n_1 = 5 \implies n_1 = 27$$
      - **Subnet Mask**: /27.
    - **Subnet 2 (16 addresses)**: $$2^{32-n_2} = 16$$, where $$n_2$$ is the number of network bits.
      - Solve for $$n_2$$: $$32 - n_2 = 4 \implies n_2 = 28$$
      - **Subnet Mask**: /28.
    - **Subnet 3 (16 addresses)**: $$2^{32-n_3} = 16$$ where $$n_3$$ is the number of network bits.
      - Solve for $$n_3$$: $$32 - n_3 = 4 \implies n_3 = 28$$
      - **Subnet Mask**: /28.

**How Does an ISP Get Blocks of Addresses?**
- ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers): Responsible for allocating IP addresses globally. Manages DNS root zones (e.g., .com, .edu).
    - ICANN allocates addresses to 5 Regional Registries (RRs).
    - RRs further distribute these blocks to local registries and ISPs.
      
**Are There Enough 32-Bit IP Addresses?**
- The last chunk of IPv4 addresses was allocated to RRs in 2011. IPv4 has a limited 32-bit address space.
- Solutions to IPv4 Exhaustion:NAT (Network Address Translation) and IPv6 has a 128-bit address space, significantly larger than IPv4.


### 4.3.3 Network Address Translation (NAT)
- NAT allows multiple devices in a local network to share one public IPv4 address as seen by the outside world.
  
<img width="675" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-10 at 3 21 49 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2513051-5fd1-4839-8fce-80f856b0f6a0">

- **Local Network Traffic** Devices in the local network use private IP addresses for communication within the network. Example: Devices like 10.0.0.1, 10.0.0.2, etc.
    -  all devices in local network have 32-bit addresses in a “private” IP address space (10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16 prefixes) that can only be used in local network
- **Traffic Leaving the Network:** All outgoing traffic is assigned the same public NAT IP address (e.g., 138.76.29.7). Source Port Numbers differentiate each device's traffic.
- **Traffic Entering the Network:** the NAT router translates the incoming public IP traffic back to the appropriate private IP device using the port mapping.
- advantages:
    - just one IP address needed from provider ISP for all devices
    - can change addresses of host in local network without notifying outside world
    - can change ISP without changing addresses of devices in local network
    - security: devices inside local net not directly addressable, visible by outside world
      
**Outgoing Datagrams** When a device in the local network sends a datagram to the internet 
- replace (source IP address, Source Port Number) of every outgoing datagram to (NAT's Public IP Address, new port #)
- Remote clients/servers on the internet cannot use private IPs, so they respond to the NAT's public IP and port as dest.

**Maintain a NAT Translation Table** The NAT router keeps a translation table to track mappings between (source IP address, Source Port Number) to (NAT's Public IP Address, new port #)
- To identify which local device sent the request and forward responses back to the correct device.

** Incoming Datagrams** When a device in the local network sends a datagram to the internet 
- replace (NAT's Public IP Address, new port #) destination fields of every incoming datagram with corresponding (source IP address, Source Port Number) stored in the table

- <img width="731" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-10 at 4 05 29 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69b8f999-d91a-4b88-9eda-59cd95070c6f">

**Why NAT is Controversial**
- Port numbers are designed to identify specific processes on a device, not to distinguish devices themselves, which NAT forces them to do.
- Routers are supposed to operate only at Layer 3 (Network Layer) (handling IP addresses). NAT involves modifying transport layer information (Layer 4), such as port numbers, which goes beyond a router's intended function.
- The end-to-end argument suggests that communication between two endpoints should not be altered or intercepted by intermediate devices. NAT disrupts this by modifying IP addresses and port numbers.
- If a client wants to initiate a connection to a server behind a NAT (e.g., for hosting a website), the NAT must implement complex solutions like port forwarding or Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) to enable the connection.
- IPv4 Address Shortage Should Be Solved by IPv6: The root problem NAT addresses—limited IPv4 addresses—should theoretically be resolved by IPv6 adoption, which offers a much larger address space.

 ### 4.3.4 IPv6
- The IPv4 address space (32-bit) was nearing complete allocation due to the growing number of devices.
- IPv6 increases the address length from 32 bits to 128 bits, ensuring an unlimited supply of IP addresses.
- Additional Motivations:
    - Streamlined Header: A fixed-length 40-byte header simplifies and accelerates packet processing and forwarding.
    - Flow Labeling and Priority: Enables unique handling of "flows" (e.g., real-time or special services). Labels packets for differentiated treatment in the network layer.
      
**IPv6 Datagram Format**
 - the size of the source and destination addresses is increased **from 32 to 128 bits**: every grain of sand on the planet can be addressable.
Unicast and multicast addresses are joind by the **anycast address** which allow a datagram to be delivered to any one of a group of hosts.
 - A number of IPv4 fields have been dropped or made optional resulting in a **40-byte fixed-length header** which allows faster datagram processing.
 - *Flow label* not clear definition. 20-bit
 - *Version*: 4-bit for IPv6 or 4. If ipv6 -> 0110
 - *Traffic class*: 8 bit similar to TOS
 - *Payload length*: 16 bit unsigned integer indicating number of bytes following the 40-byte datagram header
 - *Next header*: transport layer protocol
 - *Hop limit*: decremented by one by each router forwarding the datagram, when 0, the datagram is discarded

**Key Features**
- 128-bit source and destination addresses provide scalability.
- Priority Field: Assigns priority levels among datagrams within the same flow.
- Flow Label: Identifies datagrams belonging to the same "flow" for specialized treatment.

**What’s Missing Compared to IPv4:**
- No Checksum: Simplifies processing at routers, increasing speed.
- No Fragmentation/Reassembly: Reduces processing overhead.
- No Options: Upper-layer protocols now handle optional features

#### Transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6
- Not all routers can be upgraded simultaneously. Upgrading requires managing millions of devices and administrators. and Networks must support a mix of IPv4 and IPv6 during the transition.
- Tunneling: IPv6 datagrams are carried as payload inside IPv4 datagrams. This process enables IPv6 routers to communicate across IPv4 networks by encapsulating IPv6 packets within IPv4.
- Encapsulation: The IPv6 packet becomes part of the IPv4 payload, creating a "packet within a packet."
- Tunneling is used extensively in networks, including 4G/5G systems.
- Supports incremental IPv6 adoption while maintaining compatibility with IPv4.

- Encapsulation: At router B, the IPv6 packet is wrapped in an IPv4 header.
- Transport: The encapsulated packet travels through the IPv4 network.
- Decapsulation: At router E, the IPv4 header is removed, and the IPv6 packet continue
